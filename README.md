This repository is used to learn the basics of Git and GitHub 

I currently have no experience with Git and GitHub, but I am motivated to practice and improve.  

I look forward to learning more about branching, committing, and collaborating on GitHub during this course.

# Motivation

I'm excited to learn Python, R, and Git because I love discovering new tools.  
I enjoy solving problems and seeing results.  
I want to become more confident in version control to collaborate with others smoothly.  
Exploring both Python and R will let me compare approaches and choose the best tool for each task.  
Finally, mastering Git will allow me to share my work and contribute to real projects with confidence.
